# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Steps to Run the Project:

    1. #Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Replace <repository-url> with the actual GitHub repository URL.

Navigate into the Project Directory: After cloning, navigate into the project folder using:

bash

cd <project-folder-name>

Replace <project-folder-name> with the name of the cloned folder.

Install Dependencies: Install the required npm packages by running:

bash

npm install

This will read the package.json file and install all the necessary dependencies like React, Vite, and any plugins.

Start the Development Server: To start the Vite development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), run the following command:

bash

npm run dev

This will start the development server, and you'll get a local URL, typically http://localhost:5173, where you can view the project in your browser.

Lint the Project (Optional): If ESLint is configured, you can run the linter to check for coding issues by running:

bash

npm run lint

Build the Project for Production (Optional): If you want to create a production build of the project, you can run:

bash

npm run build

This will generate an optimized build inside a dist folder.

Preview the Production Build (Optional): To preview how the production build will look, you can run:

bash

npm run preview

This command will serve the content of the dist folder to allow you to check the production build locally.
