# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Steps to Run the Project:

# 1. Clone the Repository: 
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command to clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/AmanKumarVerma11/shubhamPortfolio.git

# 2. Navigate into the Project Directory: 
After cloning, navigate into the project folder using:

    cd shubhamPortfolio

# 3. Install Dependencies: 
Install the required npm packages by running:

    npm install

This will read the package.json file and install all the necessary dependencies, such as React, Vite, and any plugins.

# 4. Start the Development Server: 
To start the Vite development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), run the following command:

    npm run dev

This will start the development server, and you'll get a local URL, typically http://localhost:5173, where you can view the project in your browser.

# 5. Lint the Project (Optional): 
If ESLint is configured, you can run the linter to check for coding issues by running:

    npm run lint

# 6. Build the Project for Production (Optional): 
If you want to create a production build of the project, you can run:

    npm run build

This will generate an optimized build inside a dist folder.

# 7. Preview the Production Build (Optional): 
To preview how the production build will look, you can run:

    npm run preview

This command will serve the content of the dist folder to allow you to check the production build locally.
